        <p id-="p01">I'm from Tucson, born and raised. I went to Marana High school and graduated just this last year.I
            took a
            coding
            class in high school, and enjoyed it which definetly influenced me. I joined the workforce at 16 as a cafe
            attendent at Best Western. After a few months I changed jobs to a
            high class restuarant called North Italia where i've been working evver since.
